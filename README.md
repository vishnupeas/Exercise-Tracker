## Exercise-Tracker
is a small project extended to test the power of pure React on its own with the use of express as a backend to power up the react side. Bootstrap along with my own custom made made inline CSS is being used to style the entire website which is being made responsible to useres. This is just a demo project on how React is being used to help with the input form fields along with the props system which is being used to pass states and functions so that there is a good interaction between parent and child component.
