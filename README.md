## Exercise-Tracker
is a small project extended to test the power of pure React on its own with the use of express as a backend to power up the react side. Bootstrap along with my own custom made made inline CSS is being used to style the entire website which is being made responsible to useres. This is just a demo project on how React is being used to help with the input form fields along with the props system which is being used to pass states and functions so that there is a good interaction between parent and child component.

The Home page contains details about the list of exercises with description , duration and date of doing the exercise. The Users are able to modify or delete the exercise on the same page itself by clicking on the icons on the right side. A new User can be created by entering just the username in the Create User page and the new exercise that is being made from the Create exercise Log is made using the username created and automatically redirects to homepage after creation of the new exercise.
